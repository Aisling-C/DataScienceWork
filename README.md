## My Springboard Data Science Work 

Completed as a fellow of Springboard's Data Science Career Track, part of the Springboard School of Data.

The capstone projects are independent work that incoporate the full breadth of the data science life cycle, from problem identification through modeling and results sharing. 
They were completed under the supervision of my Springboard mentor, Tommy Blanchard. The projects are: 

* Capstone Project 1: Predicting Sepsis. With the data from 40,000 ICU patients, created a model to predict whether a patient would develop sepsis or not. 
* Capstone Project 2: Diabetes Prevalence. Used demographic data to predict changes in diabetes prevalence in the US. 

Course Work is contained in the Curriculum Units Folder.
